INSTALL

System wide install
===================

  su -c "make install"

Installs into /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/man, /etc.

Per user install
================

  make install PREFIX=~ CONFDIR=~/ports

This requires ~/bin in PATH and ~/man in MANPATH. Backup your
configuration files in ~/ports before doing this, as they will be
replaced.

Making a package
================

Install to a different destination with DESTDIR for makepkg. Example:

  mkdir /tmp/package-portpkg
  make PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=/tmp/package-portpkg

No installation at all
======================

The main script does not need any installation nor does it depend on any
other files, just make sure it is executable:

  chmod +x portpkg
