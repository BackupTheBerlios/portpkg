About The Portpkg Project

   Portpkg is a ports system for Slackware Linux. Its purpose is to
   build and manage a larger set of software for Slackware.

   The intention is not to provide binary packages, but to collect
   scripts that download, compile and install software on the local
   machine. The implementation is very simple and automated while it
   still gains the maximum possible "Slackwareness". It is pleased to
   contribute to the project by simply uploading own scripts, our crew
   will merge them into the collection.

Contribute

   If you want to contribute to this project, then read on, there're many
   ways to help us:

  Bug Reporting

     o If you use portpkg and something doesn't work, upload the buildlog!
       You can find it in /tmp, it is called buildlog-<portname>, go to
       http://portpkg.berlios.de and click browse and upload it. This is
       anonymous, and helps a lot!
     o If you have a clue what is borked, send a short bug-report on
       http://portpkg.berlios.de.
     o If you know how to fix a broken SlackBuild and want to code directly
       as a maintainer, ask me for a CVS-account!

  Contributing Ports

     o Make ports you missed in the ports collection. A good starting point
       is the autoport script from the portpkg package. See also QuickStart
       and PortpkgGuide. Upload them on http://portpkg.berlios.de either with
       the web panel on the right or the integrated export action (portpkg
       --export). They will be automatically committed into the group open/
       within the next hour and checked later to be merged to the collection.
     o If you miss dependencies or descriptions or something leave a message
       for the maintainer.
     o If you find annoying dependencies being actually optional, tell us.
