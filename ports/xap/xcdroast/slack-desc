xcdroast: Graphical frontend for cdrtools.
xcdroast:
xcdroast: X-CD-Roast is a graphical frontend for the command line
xcdroast: cdrtools. You can do anything X-CD-Roast does yourself using
xcdroast: the command line tools - but it's nicer and easier with the
xcdroast: frontend. The cdrtools contain cdrecord which does the actual
xcdroast: writing of CDs, readcd reads data tracks of CDs, mkisofs masters
xcdroast: CD images, and cdda2wav reads audio tracks. Cdrecord, readcd
xcdroast: and mkisofs are maintained by Joerg Schilling, cdda2wav by Heiko
xcdroast: Eissfeldt, and X-CD-Roast by Thomas Niederreiter.
