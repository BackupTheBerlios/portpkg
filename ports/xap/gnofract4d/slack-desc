gnofract4d: A flexible, easy-to-use fractal generator

gnofract4d: Gnofract 4D is a program which allow you to create beautiful
gnofract4d: mathematically-based images called fractals.

gnofract4d: What sets it apart from other fractal programs (and makes
gnofract4d: it "4D") is the way that it treats the Mandelbrot and Julia
gnofract4d: sets as different views of the same four-dimensional fractal
gnofract4d: object. This allows you to generate images which are a cross
gnofract4d: between the two sets and explore their inter-relationships.
