gdvdshrink: gDVDshrink is a very simple application that lets you choose
gdvdshrink: your favourite DVD title, its audio tracks and, hopefully,
gdvdshrink: subtitles in the future, and then recompresses the MPEG-2 video
gdvdshrink: stream quickly so that the newly reauthored DVD fits on an
gdvdshrink: 4.2 GB onle-layer DVD. Enjoy and send bugs... gDVDshrink uses
gdvdshrink: mplayer for title previewing, lsdvd for getting the information
gdvdshrink: about the source DVD, and vamps for straming and recompressing
gdvdshrink: the final DVD.
