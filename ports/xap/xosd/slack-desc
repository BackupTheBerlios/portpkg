xosd: XOSD displays text on your screen, sounds simple right? The difference
xosd: is it is unmanaged and shaped, so it appears transparent. This
xosd: gives the effect of an On Screen Display, like your TV/VCR etc.. The
xosd: package also includes an xmms plugin, which automatically displays
xosd: various interesting things as they change (song name, volume etc...)
