MPLAYER AND DEPENDENCIES
------------------------

MPlayer is a feature monster. It can do almost everything if you have
the libraries, which mplayer autodetects on configuring the source.

PLEASE check the 'optional'-entries in the requires file and pre-install
the things you like, because they really are not essential for mplayer to
run but can be quite nice to have.
