MPLAYER AND DEPENDENCIES:

MPlayer can be built with support for many *optional* libraries.

These lists of required and optional dependencies is therefore incomplete:
You may not want to have all that dependencies or you may want to have
support for more special features which need that you have other packages
installed *before* you build MPlayer.

I have decided to only include Slackware packages in the requires-file itself,
(the requires-file is obligatory and this should be ok, since most of Slackware
systems are full-installations) and to put any other found dependency to
optional.

Note: You can always run portpkg --noreqs mplayer to skip dependencies
checking at all!

-----------------

EDIT: I moved optional packages to optional and packages that are _really_ required to 'requires'.
Correct me if this is wrong, but -q isn't a solution cause I need at least the essential packages.
Think this is more like the main principle - mplayer detects what is installed, so if you have ogg
and use ogg, it will find and configure the player for ogg-support [for example].
