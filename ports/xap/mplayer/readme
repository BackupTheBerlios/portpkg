MPLAYER AND DEPENDENCIES:

MPlayer can be built with support for many *optional* libraries.

These lists of required and optional dependencies is therefore incomplete:
You may not want to have all that dependencies or you may want to have
support for more special features which need that you have other packages
installed *before* you build MPlayer.

I have decided to only include Slackware packages in the requires-file itself,
(the requires-file is obligatory and this should be ok, since most of Slackware
systems are full-installations) and to put any other found dependency to
optional.

Note: You can always run portpkg --noreqs mplayer to skip dependencies
checking at all!
