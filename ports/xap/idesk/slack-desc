idesk: iDesk (desktop manager)
idesk:
idesk: iDesk gives users of minimal wm's (fluxbox, pekwm,
idesk: windowmaker...) icons on their desktop. The icon graphics are
idesk: either from a png or svg (vector) file and support some eyecandy
idesk: effects like transparency. Each icon can be confgured to run one or
idesk: more shell commands and the actions which run those commands are
idesk: completely configurable. In a nutshell if you want icons on your
idesk: desktop and you don't have or dont't want KDE or gnome doing it,
idesk: you can use idesk.
