idesk: iDesk (desktop manager)
idesk:
idesk: iDesk gives users of minimal wm's (fluxbox, pekwm,
idesk: windowmaker...) icons on their desktop. The icon
idesk: graphics are either from a png or svg (vector)
idesk: file and support some eyecandy effects like
idesk: transparency. Each icon can be confgured to run one
idesk: or more shell commands and the actions which run those
idesk: commands are completely configurable. In a nutshell if
idesk: you want icons on your desktop and you don't have or
idesk: dont't want KDE or gnome doing it, you can use idesk.
