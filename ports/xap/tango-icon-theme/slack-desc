tango-icon-theme:
tango-icon-theme: This is an icon theme that follows the Tango visual
tango-icon-theme: guidelines [1]. Currently it depends on Imagemagick
tango-icon-theme: for creation of 24x24 bitmaps by adding a 1px
tango-icon-theme: padding around the 22x22px version. For GNOME and
tango-icon-theme: KDE you will also need icon-naming-utils that allow
tango-icon-theme: the theme to work in these environments before they
tango-icon-theme: follow the new naming scheme [2].
