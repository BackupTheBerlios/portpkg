picard: 
picard: The project code-named Picard is the next generation MusicBrainz
picard: tagging application. This new tagging concept is Release oriented,
picard: as opposed to track oriented like the ClassicTagger was. Picard
picard: is written in Python, which is a cross-platform language - this
picard: allows the same code to run both on Windows and on Linux. Before
picard: too long we will add Mac OS X support as well. See also the project
