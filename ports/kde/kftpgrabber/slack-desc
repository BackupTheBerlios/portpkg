kftpgrabber: KFTPGrabber - FTP client for KDE
kftpgrabber:
kftpgrabber: KFTPGrabber is a graphical FTP client for KDE.  It was started
kftpgrabber: in the year 2003, because there were no good graphical clients
kftpgrabber: for KDE and because many Linux users still use Windows FTP
kftpgrabber: clients (via Wine), since most Linux counterparts lack some
kftpgrabber: important features.  This project attempts to make available
kftpgrabber: a complete FTP client solution with support for plugins,
kftpgrabber: scripting, and many other features requested by users.
