gtk2-perl: Gtk2
gtk2-perl:
gtk2-perl: Perl bindings to the 2.x series of the Gtk+ graphical user
gtk2-perl: interface library.  This module allows you to write
gtk2-perl: graphical user interfaces in a perlish and object-oriented
gtk2-perl: way, freeing you from the casting and memory management in
gtk2-perl: C, yet remaining very close in spirit to original API.
