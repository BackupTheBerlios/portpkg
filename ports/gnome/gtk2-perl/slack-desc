glib-perl:
glib-perl: This module provides perl access to Glib and GLib's GObject
glib-perl: libraries. GLib is a portability and utility library;
glib-perl: GObject provides a generic type system with inheritance and
glib-perl: a powerful signal system.  Together these libraries are
glib-perl: used as the foundation for many of the libraries that make
glib-perl: up the Gnome environment, and are used in many unrelated
glib-perl: projects.
