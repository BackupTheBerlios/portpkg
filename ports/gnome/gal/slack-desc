gal: gal (GNOME Application Libs)
gal:
gal: This module contains some library functions that came from Gnumeric
gal: and Evolution.  The idea is to reuse the code across various larger
gal: GNOME applications that might want to use it.  The API is not frozen
gal: and might change at any time.  Larger class renaming might happen at
gal: any point without notice.  Use this library at your own risk.
