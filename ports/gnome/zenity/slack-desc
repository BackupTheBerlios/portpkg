zenity: display GTK+ dialogs
zenity:
zenity: Zenity is a tool that allows you to display Gtk+ dialog boxes
zenity: from the command line and through shell scripts. It is similar
zenity: to gdialog, but is intended to be saner. It comes from the same
zenity: family as dialog, Xdialog, and cdialog, but it surpasses those
zenity: projects by having a cooler name.
