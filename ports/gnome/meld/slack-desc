meld: Diff and merge tool.
meld:
meld: Meld is a visual diff and merge tool. It integrates especially well
meld: with CVS. The diff viewer lets you edit files in place (diffs update
meld: dynamically), and a middle column shows detailed changes and allows
meld: merges. The margins show location of changes for easy navigation,
meld: and it also features a tabbed interface that allows you to open many
meld: diffs at once.
