transcode: Transcode is a linux text-console utility for video stream
transcode: processing, running on a platform that supports shared
transcode: libraries and threads. Decoding and encoding is done by loading
transcode: modules that are responsible for feeding transcode with raw
transcode: video/audio streams (import modules) and encoding the frames
transcode: (export modules). It supports elementary video and audio frame
transcode: transformations, including de-interlacing or fast resizing of
transcode: video frames and loading of external filters.
