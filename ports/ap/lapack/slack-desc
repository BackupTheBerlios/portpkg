lapack: Linear Algebra PACKage
lapack:
lapack: LAPACK is written in Fortran77 and provides routines for solving
lapack: systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of
lapack: linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value
lapack: problems. The associated matrix factorizations (LU, Cholesky, QR,
lapack: SVD, Schur, generalized Schur) are also provided, as are related
lapack: computations such as reordering of the Schur factorizations and
lapack: estimating condition numbers.
