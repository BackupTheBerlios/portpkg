convmv: convmv (converts filenames from one encoding to another)
convmv:
convmv: convmv is meant to help convert a single filename, a directory tree
convmv: and the contained files or a whole filesystem into a different
convmv: encoding. It just converts the filenames, not the content of the
convmv: files. A special feature of convmv is that it also takes care of
convmv: symlinks, also converts the symlink target pointer in case the
convmv: symlink target is being converted, too.
