sshfs-fuse: Filesystem client based on the SSH
sshfs-fuse:
sshfs-fuse: This is a filesystem client based on the SSH File Transfer
sshfs-fuse: Protocol. Since most SSH servers already support this protocol
sshfs-fuse: it is very easy to set up: i.e. on the server side there's
sshfs-fuse: nothing to do.  On the client side mounting the filesystem is
sshfs-fuse: as easy as logging into the server with ssh.
