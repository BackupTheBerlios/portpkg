dd_rescue: An Error Prone DD
dd_rescue:
dd_rescue: dd_rescue copies data from one file or block device to
dd_rescue: another. It is intended for error recovery, so, by default,
dd_rescue: it doesn't abort on errors and it doesn't truncate the output
dd_rescue: file. It uses block sizes to quicken the copying, but falls
dd_rescue: back to small blocks upon encountering errors. It produces
dd_rescue: reports that allow you to keep track of bad blocks.
