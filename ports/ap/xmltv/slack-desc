xmltv: XMLTV is a set of utilities to manage your TV viewing. They work
xmltv: with TV listings stored in the XMLTV format, which is based on
xmltv: XML. The idea is to separate out the backend (getting the listings)
xmltv: from the frontend (displaying them for the user), and to implement
xmltv: useful operations like picking out your favourite programmes as
xmltv: filters that read and write XML documents.
