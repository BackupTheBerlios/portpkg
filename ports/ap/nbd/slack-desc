nbd: sharing block device via network
nbd:
nbd: With this thing compiled into your kernel, Linux can use a remote
nbd: server as one of its block devices. Every time the client computer
nbd: wants to read /dev/nd0, it will send a request to the server via
nbd: TCP, which will reply with the data requested. This can be used for
nbd: stations with low disk space (or even diskless - if you boot from
nbd: floppy) to borrow disk space from other computers
