tmsnc: Tmsnc (textbased MSN client)
tmsnc:
tmsnc: Tmsnc is a textbased (console) MSN client written in C. Tmsnc
tmsnc: should work on most Unix (Linux, BSD, MacOS) compatible operating
tmsnc: systems. The goal of this project is to create a client like MSN
tmsnc: Messenger (with sound, webcam and file transfer support), but without
tmsnc: any graphical features. Instead tmsnc has an interface written in
tmsnc: NCurses, a library for textbased terminal interaction.
