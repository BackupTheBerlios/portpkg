fping: fping
fping:
fping: fping is a ping like program which uses the Internet Control
fping: Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request to determine if a host
fping: is up. fping is different from ping in that you can specify
fping: any number of hosts on the command line, or specify a file
fping: containing the lists of hosts to ping. Instead of trying one
fping: host until it timeouts or replies, fping will send out a ping
fping: packet and move on to the next host in a round-robin fashion.
fping: If a host replies, it is noted and removed from the list of
fping: hosts to check. If a host does not respond within a certain
fping: time limit and/or retry limit it will be considered unreachable.
