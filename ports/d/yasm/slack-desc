yasm: YASM (Yasm Modular Assembler Project)
yasm: 
yasm: Yasm is a complete rewrite of the NASM assembler under the "new"
yasm: BSD License (some portions are under other licenses, see COPYING
yasm: for details). Yasm currently supports the x86 and AMD64 instruction
yasm: sets, accepts NASM and GAS assembler syntaxes, outputs binary, ELF32,
yasm: ELF64, RDOFF2, COFF, Win32, and Win64 object formats, and generates
yasm: source debugging information in STABS, DWARF 2, and CodeView? 8
yasm: formats. Yasm can be easily integrated into Visual Studio 2005 (see
yasm: VisualStudio2005) for assembly of NASM or GAS syntax code into Win32
yasm: or Win64 object files.
