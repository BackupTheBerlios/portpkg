ltrace: runtime library calls tracker
ltrace:
ltrace: ltrace is a debugging program which runs a specified command until
ltrace: it exits. While the command is executing, ltrace intercepts and
ltrace: records the dynamic library calls which are called by the executed
ltrace: process and the signals received by that process. It can also
ltrace: intercept and print the system calls executed by the program.
