psyco: Python compiler
psyco:
psyco: Think of Psyco as a kind of just-in-time (JIT) compiler, a little
psyco: bit like Java's, that emit machine code on the fly instead of
psyco: interpreting your Python program step by step. The difference is that
psyco: Psyco writes several version of the same blocks (a block is a bit of
psyco: a function), which are optimized by being specialized to some kinds
psyco: of variables (a "kind" can mean a type, but it is more general). The
psyco: result is that your unmodified Python programs run faster.
