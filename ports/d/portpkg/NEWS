Bugfix release 0.38.2.

06/26/2006

Intermediate release 0.38.1.

06/11/2006

I have now added support for signing contributed ports when submitting
via the HTTP backend. I recommend to make use of this feature for
every-one who is regularly committing ports in order to ensure
authentity.
You will need to install the Slackware package n/gnupg ("portpkg
n/gnupg"), to generate a key pair for the mail address given by MY_MAIL
("gpg --gen-key") and to export the public key ("gpg --armor --export
YOUR_MAIL"). Do this either by sending an email to me <topf at users dot
berlios dot de> or by exporting it to a key server ("gpg --send-key
YOUR_MAIL").

Once, this system is mature enough, GPG-signign will be required to       
contribute ports.

Release 0.38. Code name "Happy new year": Ok, listen: As you may have
noticed, I stopped working on testing/portpkg and starting
"back-porting" bug fixes and new features step-by-step to the "stable"
version in d/, which has been the recommended version for several
weeks now. I hope I didn't get out of sync with the docs because some
features that were targeted in 0.38 were dropped in order to keep the
changes low.

10/17/2005

Release 0.38test18 in testing/.
This is more a release candidate for the soon to be released upcoming
version 0.38.

10/15/2005

We are gladly expecting the 1st anniversary of the Portpkg Project, so
I decided to remove the information about this site's virginity and
give it a face lift (something that is mandatory after youth has
ended).
We are also currently celebrating Bad English Days, but everyone is
invited to make them an early finish (hint: QuestionsAndAnswers still
is a Wiki)!

10/12/2005

Release 0.38test17 in testing/.

10/07/2005

Release 0.37.3a.
Fixed a bug in md5sums checking method that doesn't work with md5sums
created by newer versions of portpkg. Please update.

08/16/2005

Non-developers, please update your Portpkg versions, since Portpkg now
supports package-blocking, which is very important.
Package-blocking; that means that one package can prevent another
package from getting installed. This is important since we have
packages with more than one version but different names (pango and
pango-devel for example). If you write such ports, please keep in mind
to add conflicting ports or packages to the 'blocks' file in the ports
directory.

08/14/2005

New CVS Mirror: cvs
-d:pserver:anonymous@buetow.org:/usr/home/cvs/portpkg co -P ports
(Thanks to Paul: http://www.buetow.org/)

04/27/2005

Testing release 0.38test in testing/.

On details see README file

04/26/2005

Currently we have the following download methods (note, that portpkg
--sync only supports the main CVS server)

  o cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.berlios.de:/cvsroot/portpkg co -P
    ports (this is our main CVS server)
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@dwarfforge.sytes.net:/portpkg co -P
    ports (many thanks to Steffen for mirroring)
  o httpup sync http://portpkg.berlios.de/ports (this is an
    experimental repository based on httpup)

04/04/2005

Release 0.37.
This release contains many bug-fixes. Thanks to all contributors and
bug hunters (lem, hnaz, sjn etc.).
All buildlogs and wgetlogs are stored in /var/log/portpkg
In non-maintainer-mode SlackBuilds use --cleanup (if supported by the
script)
Export needs a short message for the log (portpkg --export "Message
for Changelog" ports)
PORT_IS_BROKEN is now a symlink to the buildlog to make things easier
for maintainers
Introduced some more mirrors lists for source URLs
Introduced different exclude lists depending on the running Slackware
version
Please run pp-config to configure them.

03/29/2005

We have now over 500 ports. Thanks to all contributors! Keep on
submitting :)

03/12/2005

Release 0.36.
As noted below, configuration scripts locations (local.conf, ignore*,
exclude*, mirrors*) moved to /etc/portpkg, the ports tree location can
now be customised via PRT_DIR. Please move your *local* files to
/etc/portpkg.
Pp-export is now called by portpkg --export ports

03/03/2005

I've just found a bug in the testing version
(portpkg-0.35cvs-noarch-7tom and -8tom), which removes /dev/stdout (a
symlink to /dev/fd/1) when downlading in verbose mode. If you're
running the testing version, please upgrade to fix that!

02/24/2005

I have uploaded a testing version of Portpkg with some slight
differences: mirrors*, ignore*, exlcude* and local.conf are located in
/etc/portpkg which makes it possible to customise also the ports tree
(PRT_DIR in local.conf, but doesn't work with Pp-config for now!)
Autoport uses some more conservative SlackBuild methods again, it is
sensitive for update-mime-database and update-desktop-database and
installs GConf-schemas-defaults before packaging
Pp-export has been integrated into portpkg (start as portpkg --export
ports)
Pp-config uses a different way of identifying your CPU (thanks to
MPlayer's configure). Maybe it's better now. At least I found out,
mine is a athlon-4, not athlon-xp!

02/20/2005

Release 0.35.
Edit: Sorry, made some mistakes, please ensure you have release 0.35b!
CFLAGS can be set to different values (but not recommended, since it
is impossible to check, if a SlackBuild actually uses it, and you can
end up with packages named i686, but tuned for i486). Set ARCH and
CFLAGS with pp-config and if necessary check your ports for not
setting a default SLKCFLAGS.
Binary package and source code directories can be set to different
values (PKG_DIR and SRC_DIR, set them in /usr/ports/local.conf)
Subdirectory (not group!) local/ is always preferred
Reintroduced --prepare on popular request ;-): packaging only without
installing (since we have fakeroot now, it should work as it should
work)
Pp-sync-bin and Pp-clean-cache have been integrated into portpkg
--sync
Disabled Pp-sync-src until it's working better

02/08/2005

I'm currently preparing the ports collection for custom processor
optimations (via $SLKCFLAGS variables) and appreciate any help on
this. If you're brave enough, you can test different values with
ARCH=arch SLKCFLAGS="cflags" sh SlackBuild and tell me about
stability/compatibility and so forth under my mail address in
TodoBugsAbout, or post it in our Forums (see above). Thanks.

02/02/2005

Release 0.34.
Integrated fakeroot into the build process which should do the whole
thing much more secure. SlackBuilds will now be started by user
account 'nobody' with fakeroot, so any SlackBuild trying to write to
anywhere except $PKG/ will fail. If you find ports not working with
fakeroot make a touch no-fakeroot in the ports directory and leave me
a messaege about that. I will try to fix all that ports.
Disabled support for slackpkg since that doesn't work at all (the
interaction, not slackpkg).

01/23/2005

Release 0.33.
New setup script pp-config, pp-sync-dist has been renamed to
pp-sync-bin and pp-sync-slack to pp-sync-src.
Support for md5sums.
Lazy upgrading: don't upgrade dependencies (--lazy)
Major changes to Autoport.

01/10/2005

Release 0.32, code name "Hafenordnung für Schlackstoffe".
Ports that are needed by Slackware-10.0 systems only are moved to
pasture/, which in turn is removed from exclude. So anyone running
Portpkg on a Slackware-current system needs to add pasture/ manually
to his exclude.local to prevent compiling packages again that are
already in the current repositories.
mirrors is renamed to mirrors.de because it's just containing mirrors
usable for German users. (Sorry, there aren't any more mirror lists
for now). German users have to symlink mirrors.de to mirrors first to
use them.
Added a fancy search button.

12/18/2004

Moved export from the tree to /usr/bin/pp-export.
...and therefore removed export and obsolete addport, SlackBuild and
doinst.sh.

12/16/2004

Release 0.31.

12/12/2004

GNOME-2.8.2 complete! This is gnome-platform-2.8.2 and
gnome-desktop-2.8.2, except ximian-connector, gnomemeeting (didn't get
them working), gnome-volume-manager (in testing/ because of required
hal and dbus) and nautilus-cd-burner (newest version still has
problems with kernel-2.4)
Some major updates to Autoport. Moved sync-dist, sync-slack and
clean-cache to pp-sync-dist, pp-sync-slack and pp-clean-cache.
/usr/src/pseudo/dist moved to /usr/ports/z/dist.

12/10/2004

Made a bunch of long outstanding changes to the last ARCH=i486 lines.
They're now ARCH=${ARCH:-i486}.
Updated the first packages of GNOME-2.8.2 ("gnome-platform" to be
exactly). The rest will follow in the next days.

12/1/2004

It's done: Auto-committing is up and running! (Although it seems a bit
fragile for now.) Uploaded exports will be merged into the group open/
by a cron job every hour. Try our testing weeks! :) And remind me to
remove all the tests in a few weeks.
I finally found a typo ("SLKFLAGS") in the SlackBuild-skeleton that
infected about 175 ports! And nobody told me! I'm upset ;) To prevent
chaotic conditions I didn't change the revisions (EDIT: means, I
didn't change the build number, so you don't HAVE to recompile all
these ports, because it is a minor issue, but any ports you build in
future are fixed).

11/30/2004

Added some fancy statistics.
Release 0.30. CVS should work better now.
Added autoport, an improvement to addport. Autoport searches the
source file for keywords to adjust a SlackBuild.

11/24/2004

Added a simple slot system: see QuickStart and MaintainerGuide?.
Added Xfce-Goodies.
Added "metalists" for GNOME, Xfce and Xfce-Goddies (gnome.metalist,
xfce.metalist and xfce-goodies.metalist: So you can do portpkg `cat
xfce.metalist`.
Updated Abiword to 2.2.0 and moved it from testing/abiword22 to
xap/abiword, please note the name change, since it's stable now.

11/18/2004

Redesigned and rearranged the pages a bit.
New release 0.29.
Added --noreqs to disable requirements checking at all.
Added --dryrun to have an overviwe of what would happen (disable
building, donwloading and installing).
Merged maintain and sync-dist's/sync-slack's pseudo from /usr/ports to
local.conf.
addport allows now the source url as a parameter, and uses default
options if so, therefore it works nearly non-interactive.
Added Xfce-4.1.99 to testing/. A cd /usr/ports/testing; portpkg *xf*
should do it.
