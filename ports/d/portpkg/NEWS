   Portpkg
           * Moved export from the tree to /usr/bin/pp-export.

   Ports
           * ...and therefore removed export and obsolete addport, SlackBuild
             and doinst.sh.

  16/12/2004

   Portpkg
           * Release 0.31.

  12/12/2004

   Ports
           * GNOME-2.8.2 complete! This is gnome-platform-2.8.2 and
             gnome-desktop-2.8.2, except ximian-connector, gnomemeeting
             (didn't get them working), gnome-volume-manager (in testing/
             because of required hal and dbus) and nautilus-cd-burner (newest
             version still has problems with kernel-2.4)

   Portpkg
           * Some major updates to Autoport. Moved sync-dist, sync-slack and
             clean-cache to pp-sync-dist, pp-sync-slack and pp-clean-cache.
             /usr/src/pseudo/dist moved to /usr/ports/z/dist.

  12/10/2004

   Ports
           * Made a bunch of long outstanding changes to the last ARCH=i486
             lines. They're now ARCH=${ARCH:-i486}.
           * Updated the first packages of GNOME-2.8.2 ("gnome-platform" to
             be exactly). The rest will follow in the next days.

  12/1/2004

   Platform
           * It's done: Auto-committing is up and running! (Although it seems
             a bit fragile for now.) Uploaded exports will be merged into the
             group open/ by a cron job every hour. Try our testing weeks! :)
             And remind me to remove all the tests in a few weeks.

   Ports
           * I finally found a typo ("SLKFLAGS") in the SlackBuild-skeleton
             that infected about 175 ports! And nobody told me! I'm upset ;)
             To prevent chaotic conditions I didn't change the revisions
             (EDIT: means, I didn't change the build number, so you don't
             HAVE to recompile all these ports, because it is a minor issue,
             but any ports you build in future are fixed).

  11/30/2004

   Platform
           * Added some fancy statistics.

   Portpkg
           * Release 0.30. CVS should work better now.
           * Added autoport, an improvement to addport. Autoport searches the
             source file for keywords to adjust a SlackBuild.

  11/24/2004

   Portpkg
           * Added a simple slot system: see QuickStart and MaintainerGuide.

   Ports
           * Added Xfce-Goodies.
           * Added "metalists" for GNOME, Xfce and Xfce-Goddies
             (gnome.metalist, xfce.metalist and xfce-goodies.metalist: So you
             can do portpkg `cat xfce.metalist`.
           * Updated Abiword to 2.2.0 and moved it from testing/abiword22 to
             xap/abiword, please note the name change, since it's stable now.

  11/18/2004

   Platform
           Redesigned and rearranged the pages a bit.

   Portpkg
           * New release 0.29.
           * Added --noreqs to disable requirements checking at all.
           * Added --dryrun to have an overviwe of what would happen (disable
             building, donwloading and installing).
           * Merged maintain and sync-dist's/sync-slack's pseudo from
             /usr/ports to local.conf.

   Ports
           * addport allows now the source url as a parameter, and uses
             default options if so, therefore it works nearly
             non-interactive.
           * Added Xfce-4.1.99 to testing/. A cd /usr/ports/testing; portpkg
             *xf* should do it.
