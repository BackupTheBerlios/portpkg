     o Release 0.38. Code name "Happy new year": Ok, listen: As you may have
       noticed, I stopped working on testing/portpkg and starting
       "back-porting" bug fixes and new features step-by-step to the "stable"
       version in d/, which has been the recommended version for several
       weeks now. I hope I didn't get out of sync with the docs because some
       features that were targeted in 0.38 were dropped in order to keep the
       changes low.

  10/17/2005

     o Release 0.38test18 in testing/.
     o This is more a release candidate for the soon to be released upcoming
       version 0.38.

  10/15/2005

     o We are gladly expecting the 1st anniversary of the Portpkg Project, so
       I decided to remove the information about this site's virginity and
       give it a face lift (something that is mandatory after youth has
       ended).
     o We are also currently celebrating Bad English Days, but everyone is
       invited to make them an early finish (hint: QuestionsAndAnswers still
       is a Wiki)!

  10/12/2005

     o Release 0.38test17 in testing/.

  10/07/2005

     o Release 0.37.3a.
     o Fixed a bug in md5sums checking method that doesn't work with md5sums
       created by newer versions of portpkg. Please update.

  08/16/2005

     o Non-developers, please update your Portpkg versions, since Portpkg now
       supports package-blocking, which is very important.
     o Package-blocking; that means that one package can prevent another
       package from getting installed. This is important since we have
       packages with more than one version but different names (pango and
       pango-devel for example). If you write such ports, please keep in mind
       to add conflicting ports or packages to the 'blocks' file in the ports
       directory.

  08/14/2005

     o New CVS Mirror: cvs
       -d:pserver:anonymous@buetow.org:/usr/home/cvs/portpkg co -P ports
       (Thanks to Paul)

  04/27/2005

     o Testing release 0.38test in testing/.

     o On details see README file

  04/26/2005

     o Currently we have the following download methods (note, that portpkg
       --sync only supports the main CVS server)

          o cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.berlios.de:/cvsroot/portpkg co -P
            ports (this is our main CVS server)
            cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@dwarfforge.sytes.net:/portpkg co -P
            ports (many thanks to Steffen for mirroring)
          o httpup sync http://portpkg.berlios.de/ports (this is an
            experimental repository based on httpup)

  04/04/2005

     o Release 0.37.
     o This release contains many bug-fixes. Thanks to all contributors and
       bug hunters (lem, hnaz, sjn etc.).
     o All buildlogs and wgetlogs are stored in /var/log/portpkg
     o In non-maintainer-mode SlackBuilds use --cleanup (if supported by the
       script)
     o Export needs a short message for the log (portpkg --export "Message
       for Changelog" ports)
     o PORT_IS_BROKEN is now a symlink to the buildlog to make things easier
       for maintainers
     o Introduced some more mirrors lists for source URLs
     o Introduced different exclude lists depending on the running Slackware
       version
     o Please run pp-config to configure them.

  03/29/2005

     o We have now over 500 ports. Thanks to all contributors! Keep on
       submitting :)

  03/12/2005

     o Release 0.36.
     o As noted below, configuration scripts locations (local.conf, ignore*,
       exclude*, mirrors*) moved to /etc/portpkg, the ports tree location can
       now be customised via PRT_DIR. Please move your *local* files to
       /etc/portpkg.
     o Pp-export is now called by portpkg --export ports

  03/03/2005

     o I've just found a bug in the testing version
       (portpkg-0.35cvs-noarch-7tom and -8tom), which removes /dev/stdout (a
       symlink to /dev/fd/1) when downlading in verbose mode. If you're
       running the testing version, please upgrade to fix that!

  02/24/2005

     o I have uploaded a testing version of Portpkg with some slight
       differences: mirrors*, ignore*, exlcude* and local.conf are located in
       /etc/portpkg which makes it possible to customise also the ports tree
       (PRT_DIR in local.conf, but doesn't work with Pp-config for now!)
     o Autoport uses some more conservative SlackBuild methods again, it is
       sensitive for update-mime-database and update-desktop-database and
       installs GConf-schemas-defaults before packaging
     o Pp-export has been integrated into portpkg (start as portpkg --export
       ports)
     o Pp-config uses a different way of identifying your CPU (thanks to
       MPlayer's configure). Maybe it's better now. At least I found out,
       mine is a athlon-4, not athlon-xp!

  02/20/2005

     o Release 0.35.
     o Edit: Sorry, made some mistakes, please ensure you have release 0.35b!
     o CFLAGS can be set to different values (but not recommended, since it
       is impossible to check, if a SlackBuild actually uses it, and you can
       end up with packages named i686, but tuned for i486). Set ARCH and
       CFLAGS with pp-config and if necessary check your ports for not
       setting a default SLKCFLAGS.
     o Binary package and source code directories can be set to different
       values (PKG_DIR and SRC_DIR, set them in /usr/ports/local.conf)
     o Subdirectory (not group!) local/ is always preferred
     o Reintroduced --prepare on popular request ;-): packaging only without
       installing (since we have fakeroot now, it should work as it should
       work)
     o Pp-sync-bin and Pp-clean-cache have been integrated into portpkg
       --sync
     o Disabled Pp-sync-src until it's working better

  02/08/2005

     o I'm currently preparing the ports collection for custom processor
       optimations (via $SLKCFLAGS variables) and appreciate any help on
       this. If you're brave enough, you can test different values with
       ARCH=arch SLKCFLAGS="cflags" sh SlackBuild and tell me about
       stability/compatibility and so forth under my mail address in
       TodoBugsAbout, or post it in our Forums (see above). Thanks.

  02/02/2005

     o Release 0.34.
     o Integrated fakeroot into the build process which should do the whole
       thing much more secure. SlackBuilds will now be started by user
       account 'nobody' with fakeroot, so any SlackBuild trying to write to
       anywhere except $PKG/ will fail. If you find ports not working with
       fakeroot make a touch no-fakeroot in the ports directory and leave me
       a messaege about that. I will try to fix all that ports.
     o Disabled support for slackpkg since that doesn't work at all (the
       interaction, not slackpkg).

  01/23/2005

     o Release 0.33.
     o New setup script pp-config, pp-sync-dist has been renamed to
       pp-sync-bin and pp-sync-slack to pp-sync-src.
     o Support for md5sums.
     o Lazy upgrading: don't upgrade dependencies (--lazy)
     o Major changes to Autoport.

  01/10/2005

     o Release 0.32, code name "Hafenordnung für Schlackstoffe".
     o Ports that are needed by Slackware-10.0 systems only are moved to
       pasture/, which in turn is removed from exclude. So anyone running
       Portpkg on a Slackware-current system needs to add pasture/ manually
       to his exclude.local to prevent compiling packages again that are
       already in the current repositories.
     o mirrors is renamed to mirrors.de because it's just containing mirrors
       usable for German users. (Sorry, there aren't any more mirror lists
       for now). German users have to symlink mirrors.de to mirrors first to
       use them.
     o Added a fancy search button.

  12/18/2004

     o Moved export from the tree to /usr/bin/pp-export.
     o ...and therefore removed export and obsolete addport, SlackBuild and
       doinst.sh.

  12/16/2004

     o Release 0.31.

  12/12/2004

     o GNOME-2.8.2 complete! This is gnome-platform-2.8.2 and
       gnome-desktop-2.8.2, except ximian-connector, gnomemeeting (didn't get
       them working), gnome-volume-manager (in testing/ because of required
       hal and dbus) and nautilus-cd-burner (newest version still has
       problems with kernel-2.4)
     o Some major updates to Autoport. Moved sync-dist, sync-slack and
       clean-cache to pp-sync-dist, pp-sync-slack and pp-clean-cache.
       /usr/src/pseudo/dist moved to /usr/ports/z/dist.

  12/10/2004

     o Made a bunch of long outstanding changes to the last ARCH=i486 lines.
       They're now ARCH=${ARCH:-i486}.
     o Updated the first packages of GNOME-2.8.2 ("gnome-platform" to be
       exactly). The rest will follow in the next days.

  12/1/2004

     o It's done: Auto-committing is up and running! (Although it seems a bit
       fragile for now.) Uploaded exports will be merged into the group open/
       by a cron job every hour. Try our testing weeks! :) And remind me to
       remove all the tests in a few weeks.
     o I finally found a typo ("SLKFLAGS") in the SlackBuild-skeleton that
       infected about 175 ports! And nobody told me! I'm upset ;) To prevent
       chaotic conditions I didn't change the revisions (EDIT: means, I
       didn't change the build number, so you don't HAVE to recompile all
       these ports, because it is a minor issue, but any ports you build in
       future are fixed).

  11/30/2004

     o Added some fancy statistics.
     o Release 0.30. CVS should work better now.
     o Added autoport, an improvement to addport. Autoport searches the
       source file for keywords to adjust a SlackBuild.

  11/24/2004

     o Added a simple slot system: see QuickStart and MaintainerGuide?.
     o Added Xfce-Goodies.
     o Added "metalists" for GNOME, Xfce and Xfce-Goddies (gnome.metalist,
       xfce.metalist and xfce-goodies.metalist: So you can do portpkg `cat
       xfce.metalist`.
     o Updated Abiword to 2.2.0 and moved it from testing/abiword22 to
       xap/abiword, please note the name change, since it's stable now.

  11/18/2004

     o Redesigned and rearranged the pages a bit.
     o New release 0.29.
     o Added --noreqs to disable requirements checking at all.
     o Added --dryrun to have an overviwe of what would happen (disable
       building, donwloading and installing).
     o Merged maintain and sync-dist's/sync-slack's pseudo from /usr/ports to
       local.conf.
     o addport allows now the source url as a parameter, and uses default
       options if so, therefore it works nearly non-interactive.
     o Added Xfce-4.1.99 to testing/. A cd /usr/ports/testing; portpkg *xf*
       should do it.

  10/20/2004

     o Start of the project: Diskussion auf Slackforum.de (German)
