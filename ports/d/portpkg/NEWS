   Portpkg
           * Release 0.36.
           * As noted below, configuration scripts locations (local.conf,
             ignore*, exclude*, mirrors*) moved to /etc/portpkg, the ports
             tree location can now be customised via PRT_DIR. Please move
             your *local* files to /etc/portpkg.
           * Pp-export is now called by portpkg --export "Message for
             Changelog" ports

   Portpkg
           * I've just found a bug in the testing version
             (portpkg-0.35cvs-noarch-7tom and -8tom), which removes
             /dev/stdout (a symlink to /dev/fd/1) when downlading in verbose
             mode. If you're running the testing version, please upgrade to
             fix that!

  02/24/2005

   Portpkg
           * I have uploaded a testing version of Portpkg with some slight
             differences: mirrors*, ignore*, exlcude* and local.conf are
             located in /etc/portpkg which makes it possible to customise
             also the ports tree (PRT_DIR in local.conf, but doesn't work
             with Pp-config for now!)
           * Autoport uses some more conservative SlackBuild methods again,
             it is sensitive for update-mime-database and
             update-desktop-database and installs GConf-schemas-defaults
             before packaging
           * Pp-export has been integrated into portpkg (start as portpkg
             --export ports)
           * Pp-config uses a different way of identifying your CPU (thanks
             to MPlayer's configure). Maybe it's better now. At least I found
             out, mine is a athlon-4, not athlon-xp!

  02/20/2005

   Portpkg
           * Release 0.35.
           * Edit: Sorry, made some mistakes, please ensure you have release
             0.35b!
           * CFLAGS can be set to different values (but not recommended,
             since it is impossible to check, if a SlackBuild actually uses
             it, and you can end up with packages named i686, but tuned for
             i486). Set ARCH and CFLAGS with pp-config and if necessary check
             your ports for not setting a default SLKCFLAGS.
           * Binary package and source code directories can be set to
             different values (PKG_DIR and SRC_DIR, set them in
             /usr/ports/local.conf)
           * Subdirectory (not group!) local/ is always preferred
           * Reintroduced --prepare on popular request ;-): packaging only
             without installing (since we have fakeroot now, it should work
             as it should work)
           * Pp-sync-bin and Pp-clean-cache have been integrated into portpkg
             --sync
           * Disabled Pp-sync-src until it's working better

  02/08/2005

   Ports
           * I'm currently preparing the ports collection for custom
             processor optimations (via $SLKCFLAGS variables) and appreciate
             any help on this. If you're brave enough, you can test different
             values with ARCH=arch SLKCFLAGS="cflags" sh SlackBuild and tell
             me about stability/compatibility and so forth under my mail
             address in TodoBugsAbout, or post it in our Forums (see above).
             Thanks.

  02/02/2005

   Portpkg
           * Release 0.34.
           * Integrated fakeroot into the build process which should do the
             whole thing much more secure. SlackBuilds will now be started by
             user account 'nobody' with fakeroot, so any SlackBuild trying to
             write to anywhere except $PKG/ will fail. If you find ports not
             working with fakeroot make a touch no-fakeroot in the ports
             directory and leave me a messaege about that. I will try to fix
             all that ports.
           * Disabled support for slackpkg since that doesn't work at all
             (the interaction, not slackpkg).

  01/23/2005

   Portpkg
           * Release 0.33.
           * New setup script pp-config, pp-sync-dist has been renamed to
             pp-sync-bin and pp-sync-slack to pp-sync-src.
           * Support for md5sums.
           * Lazy upgrading: don't upgrade dependencies (--lazy)
           * Major changes to Autoport.

  01/10/2005

   Portpkg
           * Release 0.32, code name "Hafenordnung für Schlackstoffe".

   Ports
           * Ports that are needed by Slackware-10.0 systems only are moved
             to pasture/, which in turn is removed from exclude. So anyone
             running Portpkg on a Slackware-current system needs to add
             pasture/ manually to his exclude.local to prevent compiling
             packages again that are already in the current repositories.
           * mirrors is renamed to mirrors.de because it's just containing
             mirrors usable for German users. (Sorry, there aren't any more
             mirror lists for now). German users have to symlink mirrors.de
             to mirrors first to use them.

   Platform
           * Added a fancy search button.

  12/18/2004

   Portpkg
           * Moved export from the tree to /usr/bin/pp-export.

   Ports
           * ...and therefore removed export and obsolete addport, SlackBuild
             and doinst.sh.

  12/16/2004

   Portpkg
           * Release 0.31.

  12/12/2004

   Ports
           * GNOME-2.8.2 complete! This is gnome-platform-2.8.2 and
             gnome-desktop-2.8.2, except ximian-connector, gnomemeeting
             (didn't get them working), gnome-volume-manager (in testing/
             because of required hal and dbus) and nautilus-cd-burner (newest
             version still has problems with kernel-2.4)

   Portpkg
           * Some major updates to Autoport. Moved sync-dist, sync-slack and
             clean-cache to pp-sync-dist, pp-sync-slack and pp-clean-cache.
             /usr/src/pseudo/dist moved to /usr/ports/z/dist.

  12/10/2004

   Ports
           * Made a bunch of long outstanding changes to the last ARCH=i486
             lines. They're now ARCH=${ARCH:-i486}.
           * Updated the first packages of GNOME-2.8.2 ("gnome-platform" to
             be exactly). The rest will follow in the next days.

  12/1/2004

   Platform
           * It's done: Auto-committing is up and running! (Although it seems
             a bit fragile for now.) Uploaded exports will be merged into the
             group open/ by a cron job every hour. Try our testing weeks! :)
             And remind me to remove all the tests in a few weeks.

   Ports
           * I finally found a typo ("SLKFLAGS") in the SlackBuild-skeleton
             that infected about 175 ports! And nobody told me! I'm upset ;)
             To prevent chaotic conditions I didn't change the revisions
             (EDIT: means, I didn't change the build number, so you don't
             HAVE to recompile all these ports, because it is a minor issue,
             but any ports you build in future are fixed).

  11/30/2004

   Platform
           * Added some fancy statistics.

   Portpkg
           * Release 0.30. CVS should work better now.
           * Added autoport, an improvement to addport. Autoport searches the
             source file for keywords to adjust a SlackBuild.

  11/24/2004

   Portpkg
           * Added a simple slot system: see QuickStart and MaintainerGuide.

   Ports
           * Added Xfce-Goodies.
           * Added "metalists" for GNOME, Xfce and Xfce-Goddies
             (gnome.metalist, xfce.metalist and xfce-goodies.metalist: So you
             can do portpkg `cat xfce.metalist`.
           * Updated Abiword to 2.2.0 and moved it from testing/abiword22 to
             xap/abiword, please note the name change, since it's stable now.

  11/18/2004

   Platform
           Redesigned and rearranged the pages a bit.

   Portpkg
           * New release 0.29.
           * Added --noreqs to disable requirements checking at all.
           * Added --dryrun to have an overviwe of what would happen (disable
             building, donwloading and installing).
           * Merged maintain and sync-dist's/sync-slack's pseudo from
             /usr/ports to local.conf.

   Ports
           * addport allows now the source url as a parameter, and uses
             default options if so, therefore it works nearly
             non-interactive.
           * Added Xfce-4.1.99 to testing/. A cd /usr/ports/testing; portpkg
             *xf* should do it.
