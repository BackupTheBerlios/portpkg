  Slackports

   "[The slackports project] aim at creating a light BSD-like ports system

  Dropline GNOME's Build System

   "The Dropline Build System provides a simple interface for compiling and

Unspecific Portsystems

  Pkgbuilder

   "Se podria decir que esto es el embrion de un arbol de ports para sistemas
   Linux, aunque ahora mismo se trata solo de una serie de scripts bash que
   automatizan la construccion de paquetes."

  Pkgsrc: The NetBSD Packages Collection

   "The NetBSD Packages Collection (pkgsrc) is a framework for building
   third-party software on NetBSD and other UNIX-like systems, currently
   containing nearly 5000 packages. It is used to enable freely available
   software to be configured and built easily on supported platforms."

  GARNOME: A Build Utility For The GNOME Desktop

   "GARNOME began as a project to allow users to build the GNOME desktop,
   without falling victim to the depravities of CVS, non-standard build tools
   and other forms of co-dependance."

Other Distributions's Portsystems

  Portage

   "Portage is probably Gentoo's most notable innovation in software
   management. With its high flexibility and enormous amount of features it

   Linux."

  CRUX

   "CRUX is a lightweight, i686-optimized Linux distribution targeted at
   experienced Linux users. The primary focus of this distribution is "keep
   it simple", which is reflected in a simple tar.gz-based package system,
   BSD-style initscripts, and a relatively small collection of trimmed
   packages. The secondary focus is utilization of new Linux features and
   recent tools and libraries. CRUX also has a ports system which makes it
   easy to install and upgrade applications."

Other Usefull Documentation

  Filesystem Hierarchy Standard

   "This standard consists of a set of requirements and guidelines for file
   and directory placement under UNIX-like operating systems. The guidelines
   are intended to support interoperability of applications, system
   administration tools, development tools, and scripts as well as greater
   uniformity of documentation for these systems."

   http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html

  GoboLinux

   "GoboLinux is an alternative Linux distribution which redefines the entire
   filesystem hierarchy. In GoboLinux you don't need a package manager
   because the filesystem is the package manager: each program resides in its
   own directory, such as /Programs/Xorg/6.7.0/ and /Programs/KDE/3.2.2. Like
   it? Read more..."

  GNU Stow

   "GNU Stow is a program for managing the installation of software packages,
   keeping them separate (/usr/local/stow/emacs vs. /usr/local/stow/perl, for
   example) while making them appear to be installed in the same place
   (/usr/local)."

   http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/stow.html

  Autopackage

   "This is autopackage, the distro neutral binary packaging framework for
   Linux systems.

     o Build packages that will install on many different distros
     o Multiple front ends: best is automatically chosen so GUI users get a
       graphical front end, and command line users get a text based interface
     o Multiple language support (both in tools and for your own packages)
     o Automatically verifies and resolves dependencies no matter how the
       software was installed. This means you don't have to use autopackage
       for all your software, or even any of it, for packages to succesfully
       install."
