# This is an additional list of ports that are already part of Slackware current.
# It is recommended to add these ports to your exclude.local or to make a
# symlink to this file if you are running Slackware current.
#
# This list is updated automatically on every Portpkg release. Don't bother
# if it's empty. :)
