[1]QuickStart

   This page addresses a very short introduction to the most important
   components of the Portpkg Project.

   There are two ways of using the ports collection: the puristic way, only
   the SlackBuild scripts, is a bit hard to use, or the comfortable way with
   the administration tool portpkg which is recommended.

1. The comfortable way: portpkg

   If you want to have a quick look into what Portpkg does, download the
   latest package [2]here and install it with:

 # installpkg portpkg-xxx-noarch-1tom.tgz

   Now you can fetch the complete current ports collection:

 # portpkg --sync

   After --sync, you can find out if there's an update for portpkg available:

 # portpkg portpkg

   Portpkg uses the directories /usr/ports, /usr/obj/pkg and /usr/src/dist to
   store the SlackBuild scripts, source packages and binary packages. You can
   have a list of all available ports with:

 $ portpkg --list

   To build and install a port to your system, just type in the short name of
   the port:

 # portpkg id3lib

   It is always recommended to do a dry-run first, to see, what would happen:

 # portpkg --dryrun id3lib

   In doubt you can specify the port with the group and/or the long name to
   define the port more precisely or imply whole groups also, otherwise
   portpkg will use the first port that fits your mask:

 $ portpkg --info l/id3lib dia-0.94-i486-1tom gnome/

  1.1 Working with ports

   "Packages as mom does"

   First of all: Writing new ports can be quite easy, but can also become
   hard work and implies at least the possibility to shred your system! The
   procedure described here, is subject to certain conditions (one script
   just writes another script, and that could fail). So instead of just using
   portpkg, writing ports is more difficult and you should now what you are
   doing, this is at your own risk!

   The package portpkg contains a script called autoport, that will assist
   you to prepare a SlackBuild and some useful other files if you have a
   given source code URL. Normally the default answers (encluded in [ and ])
   should be the right choice, so just press enter (if this is the first time
   you use autoport, you will be asked for a tag, which will be stored in
   /usr/ports/local.conf).

   Now your desired port can be used if anything goes right:

 # autoport
 (...)
 # portpkg my-new-port

   We hope you plan to contribute your ports to this project, it is a simple
   task! First you have to make a tarball of your ports (here you will be
   asked for your mail address and your real name, so we can contact you
   later):

 $ cd /usr/ports
 $ ./export

   Now there's your tarball in /usr/ports, called ports-yourtag-date.tar.bz2.
   Please make sure, it's not getting too big! Normally, a port just needs
   the files SlackBuild, slack-desc, sources and requires.

2. Alternative: The puristic way without portpkg

   "Just the ports, nothing else, please!"

   You can use the ports tree without portpkg at all! It is just like the
   source/ directory on a Slackware repository. Get the complete tree via
   CVS:

 $ cvs -z9 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.berlios.de:/cvsroot/portpkg co ports

   You should definitely have a look at [5]UserGuide and [6]MaintainerGuide
   now.
