About

   Portpkg is a ports system for Slackware Linux. Its purpose is to build and
   manage a larger set of software for Slackware.

   This is done not by provding binary packages, but by collecting scripts
   that download, compile and install software on your machine. The
   implementation is very simple and automated while still gaining the
   maximum possible "Slackwareness". Contribution of own ports is realised by
   uploading them onto our server which commits them into an open directory.
   Our Crew will later merge them into the ports tree.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Todo

     o Support for three architectures: i486, s390 and x86_64. i486 will be
       the default architecture, so our ports will have either ARCH=noarch or
       ARCH=${ARCH:-i486} in the SlackBuild, portpkg should be able to
       detect, what architecture is to be build.

     o Double check all ports. Make them 100 % work on Slackware 10.0.

     o Option: Support for CVS or maybe RSYNC, SVN in sources.

     o Option: Fakeroot? Building packages as user.

     o Option: Cooperation with slackpkg (or slapt-get/swaret) for dependency
       resolution of Slackware packages?

     o Option: Data integrity checking? (MD5? GPG?)

     o Find a way to get over the differences between release (10.0) and
       current. Some ports need newer versions of a dependency that is not in
       10.0 (e.g. gtk+2-2.4), but in current (gtk+2-2.6). And current system
       shouldn't need to compile that again.

     o Have some localised mirrors-files. The existing one has just mirros
       for Germany. Maybe a symlink to mirrors.de etc.?

     o Feature freeze, then beta-status, documentation, maybe translation.

Contribute

   If you want to contribute to this project, then read on, there're many
   ways to help us:

  Bug reporting

     o If you use portpkg and something doesn't work, upload the buildlog!
       You can find it in /tmp, it is called buildlog-<portname>, go to
       http://portpkg.berlios.de and click browse and upload it. This is
       anonymous, and helps a lot!

     o If you have a clue what is borked, send a short bug-report on
       http://portpkg.berlios.de.

     o If you know how to fix a broken SlackBuild and want to code directly
       as a maintainer, ask me for a CVS-account!

  Contributing ports

     o Make ports you missed in the ports collection. A good starting point
       is the addport script in /usr/ports (EDIT: or autoport from the
       portpkg package). See also QuickStart and MaintainerGuide. Upload them
       on http://portpkg.berlios.de with the panel on the right. They will be
       automatically committed into the group open/ within the next hour and
       checked later to be merged to the collection.

     o If you miss dependencies or descriptions or something leave a message
       for the maintainer.

Known bugs

   These are often reported bugs. Please do so and send your buildlog, if
   something hangs.

   Portpkg
           * Sync does nothing: Because we moved the tree from http to cvs,
             there might be problems to sync your tree. Work around: Remove
             your ports tree, and try again. Make sure you have version 0.28
             or higher.

   Ports
           * SlackBuilds look for .gz while sources has .bz2 or vice-versa.
           * Incomplete requirements-list, portpkg stops.
