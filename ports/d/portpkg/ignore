#
# IGNORE these ports for dependencies (when making the "requires" file)
# Maintainers should add these dependencies manually if really needed.
# The purpose of this file is to trim the automatically found requirements
# for earch "requires" files in order to get some meaningful dependencies.
# Intentionally (manually) added dependencies that are listed here won't
# be removed, but give a warning at build time for the maintainer to
# re-check the relevance.
#

# Slackware packages that are either installed anyway or just optional
# (use complete packages instead of -solibs)
