About The Portpkg Project

   Portpkg is a ports system for Slackware Linux. Its purpose is to build and
   manage a larger set of software for Slackware.

   This is done not by provding binary packages, but by collecting scripts
   that download, compile and install software on your machine. The
   implementation is very simple and automated while still gaining the
   maximum possible "Slackwareness". Contribution of own ports is realised by
   uploading them onto our server which commits them into an open directory.
   Our Crew will later merge them into the ports tree.

Contribute

   If you want to contribute to this project, then read on, there're many
   ways to help us:

  Bug Reporting

     o If you use portpkg and something doesn't work, upload the buildlog!
       You can find it in /tmp, it is called buildlog-<portname>, go to
       http://portpkg.berlios.de and click browse and upload it. This is
       anonymous, and helps a lot!
     o If you have a clue what is borked, send a short bug-report on
       http://portpkg.berlios.de.
     o If you know how to fix a broken SlackBuild and want to code directly
       as a maintainer, ask me for a CVS-account!

  Contributing Ports

     o Make ports you missed in the ports collection. A good starting point
       is the autoport script from the portpkg package. See also QuickStart
       and PortpkgGuide. Upload them on http://portpkg.berlios.de either with
       the web panel on the right or the integrated export action (portpkg
       --export). They will be automatically committed into the group open/
       within the next hour and checked later to be merged to the collection.
     o If you miss dependencies or descriptions or something leave a message
       for the maintainer.
     o If you find annoying dependencies being actually optional, tell us.
