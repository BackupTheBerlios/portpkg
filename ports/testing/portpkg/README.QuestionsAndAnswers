  My /tmp is being bloated, why and how to prevent?

   Your /tmp directory will be filled while compiling with source code,
   object code and packages, which isn't needed anymore, once the package is
   built. It is recommended to delete that on every boot (see Filesystem
   Hierarchy Standard in Links):

 echo 'rm -rf /tmp/*' >>/etc/rc.d/rc.local

  I get "Cannot find required package xyz! Stopping." so often... ?!

   Run pp-config and configure to use Slackware's binaries (resources). After
   next portpkg --sync Portpkg resolves dependencies to Slackware packages
   automatically.

  I don't want to know anything about "dependencies" or "requirements"... Can I
  turn that off?

   Yes, with -q in the command line or add NO_REQS=true in
   /usr/ports/local.conf.

  I want to recompile Slackware's apmd (or xyz) for my athlon-tbird. How?

   Download Slackware's SlackBuild (and any other file), add
   CFLAGS="$SLKCFLAGS" \ right before ./configure if it doesn't exist. You
   must set ARCH and CFLAGS in your /usr/ports/local.conf (best with
   pp-config). See PortpkgGuide.

  Does it work with installpkg and removepkg?

   Yes, it does. After building the package, portpkg calls upgradepkg
   --reinstall <pkg> which replaces your new packge with its older version,
   if there's one installed, otherwise it acts like a installpkg <pkg>. As
   any Slackware packages, you can remove it with removepkg <pkg>.

  There are so few mirror list files and none of them fits my needs. What to do?

   You can use Portpkg without mirrors. You can add your own preferred mirror
   sites to mirrors.local.

  I'm using this Slackware-binaries-sync-addon-thing, but I want to use gcc-3.4
  from testing/. Portpkg always wants to downgrade to gcc-3.3 from d/. Hm?

   Make a symlink in local/ to gcc-3.4. local/ is always preferred, and
   Slackware's testing tree (in /usr/ports/z/bin/z/testing) is mostly
   overlapped by stable versions:

 # mkdir /usr/ports/local
 # cd /usr/ports/local
 # ln -s ../z/bin/z/testing/gcc .
 # portpkg -l
 local/gcc-3.4.3-i486-1
 (...)

   You will now have the gcc version in testing/ as default.

  How is Portpkg different from other attempts to do the same, how is Portpkg
  different from other Slackware tools?

   Other Slackware tools contain "slack" in the project name or at least
   start with an "s": slapt-get, slackpkg, swaret, slackports, slack-get,
   spkg... Portpkg is unique in this sense of feature: It starts with a "p",
   goes straight on with "ort", just to find its climax with another "p", and
   ends quickly but sudden with "kg".
