WARNING! THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL TESTING RELEASE!

Major changes:

* "Turbo mode": like *BSD portsystems:

  # cd /usr/ports/xap/mozilla
  # portpkg

  This is also a bit faster, because portpkg doesn't need to search the ports
  tree first in this mode.

* No more .local files in /etc/portpkg!

  Portpkg now uses the normal Slackware style for etc-files (.new
  files). Please edit your files in /etc/portpkg/ to your needs, they
  won't be overwritten on upgrades.

* CVS support (sources, mirrors and importer scripts)

  It should be now possible to use CVS as a resource in your ports. E.g.
  the "sources" file will look like this (as in "repos" now):

  cvs://:pserver:anonymouse@cvs.bla.net:/cvsroot/bla/$NAME

  The default CVS storage dir is /usr/src/cvs and can be changed by
  CVS_DIR=... in /etc/portpkg/local.conf. Portpkg makes a symlink to the
  port dir before starting the SlackBuild. Use it in your SlackBuild as

  ...
  # here would be normal tar xjvf $CWD/$NAME-$VERSION.tar.bz2
  cp -av $CWD/$NAME/ . # <-- watch out the trailing /
  cd $NAME || exit 1
  ...

* Import/export system

  The ports collection of Portpkg is a seperate importer script now, 
  that can be turned on and off with pp-config. Also, an export method
  can be defined to submit ports anonymously via HTTP (goes into open/)
  or via CVS if you have a developer account. Nevertheless, the CVS
  server url can be modified in a mirrors file.

* Use.local

  Dependencies that are optional AND shall be installed by portpkg when
  needed can be written to this list. Best known example is if you WANT
  GNOME dependencies for packages you are building, you SHOULD add
  gnome/ here!

Furthermore:

Portpkg:
* Handle optional dependencies in "requires" now as "# optional: dependency".
* Add newly found dependencies as optional.
* Connect arguments in --find with AND not OR.
* Fixed using of custom $TMP
* Removed "pseudo" files
* Remove arbitrary source files (%-style in "sources") after package building
* No more "arbitrary" files, only warning message
* No more ".wgetlogs"
* Don't log a dry-run
* Execute SlackBuilds with "sh -e" on default
* --ignorearch: neglect architecture diffs
* Improvements to the Slackware source importer
* Use pathname expansion rather than regular expressions in mirror files
  (http://*.dl.sf.net/ instead of http://.*\.dl\.net/)
* Ignore case in package expressions, dependencies and --diff
* Removed Bash-specific syntax (should work now with ash)
* Some speed enhancements
* Use unlisted packages in cache for dependencies
*

Autoport:
* Support also .patch.gz and doinst.gz
* Check for KDEDIRS and use prefix /opt/kde
* Add schemas files explicit to doinst.sh
* Removed "|| exit 1"
* Remove empty files in /usr/share/mime/
* Support CVS sources
* Removed Bash-specific syntax (should work now with ash)
*

* Some more changes

Enjoy.

Delayed:
* Support for different repositories (CVS and HTTPUP) (/etc/portpkg/repos)
* Removed "importers" subsystem
* PGP/GPG-Support
