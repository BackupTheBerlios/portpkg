WARNING! THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL TESTING RELEASE!

Major changes:

* CVS and HTTPUP support (sources, mirrors and importer scripts)

  Due to some changes to the download subroutine, there's a change in
  the repos layout! Please watch out! It should be now possible to use
  CVS as a resource in your ports. E.g. the "sources" file will look
  like this (as in "repos" now):

  cvs://:pserver:anonymouse@cvs.bla.net:/cvsroot/bla/$NAME

  The default CVS storage dir is /usr/src/cvs and can be changed by
  CVS_DIR=... in /etc/portpkg/local.conf. Portpkg makes a symlink to the
  port dir before starting the SlackBuild. Use it in your SlackBuild as

  ...
  # here would be normal tar xjvf $CWD/$NAME-$VERSION.tar.bz2
  cp -av $CWD/$NAME/ . # <-- watch out the trailing /
  cd $NAME || exit 1
  ...

* Import/export system

  The ports collection of Portpkg is a seperate importer script now, 
  that can be turned on and off with pp-config. Also, an export method
  can be defined to submit ports anonymously via HTTP (goes into open/)
  or via CVS if you have an developer account. The CVS server can
  neverteless be modified in a mirrors file.

* Use.local

  Dependencies that are optional AND shall be installed by portpkg when
  needed can be written to this list. Best known example is if you WANT
  GNOME dependencies for packages you are building, you SHOULD add
  gnome/ here!

Furthermore:

Portpkg:
* Handle optional dependencies in "requires" now as "# optional: dependency".
* Add newly found dependencies as optional.
* Connect arguments in --find with AND not OR.
* Fixed using of custom $TMP
* Removed "pseudo" files
* Remove arbitrary source files (%-style in "sources") after package building
* No more "arbitrary" files, only warning message
* No more ".wgetlogs"
* Don't log a dry-run
* Execute SlackBuilds with "sh -e" on default
* --ignorearch: neglect architecture diffs
* Improvements to the Slackware source importer
*

Autoport:
* Support also .patch.gz and doinst.gz
* Check for KDEDIRS and use prefix /opt/kde
* Add schemas files explicit to doinst.sh
* Removed "|| exit 1"
* Remove empty files in /usr/share/mime/
* Support CVS sources
*

* Some more changes.

Enjoy.
--tom

Delayed:
* Added support for different repositories (CVS and HTTPUP) (see /etc/portpkg/repos).
* Removed "importers" subsystem.
* PGP/GPG-Support
