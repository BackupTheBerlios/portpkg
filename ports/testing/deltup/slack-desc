deltup: deltup (source package updater)
deltup:
deltup: Deltup is a source package updater which enables users to apply
deltup: a delta patch to the previous version of a package, as well as
deltup: making delta patches for others to use.  This decreases download
deltup: times significantly.  The package/patch ratio is typically 10:1,
deltup: 20:1, and in some cases I've seen, higher than 80:1!
