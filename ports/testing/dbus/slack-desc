dbus: dbus (message bus system)
dbus:
dbus: D-BUS is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk
dbus: to one another.
dbus: 
dbus: D-BUS supplies both a system daemon (for events such as "new hardware
dbus: device added" or "printer queue changed") and a per-user-login-session
dbus: daemon (for general IPC needs among user applications). Also, the
dbus: message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message passing
dbus: framework, which can be used by any two apps to communicate directly
dbus: (without going through the message bus daemon).
