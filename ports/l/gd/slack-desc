gd: gd is the image manipulating library. It was created to allow graphs,
gd: charts and the like to be generated on the fly for use on the World
gd: wide Web, but is useful for any application in which custom images

gd: creates PNG, JPEG and WBMP images. This is a good thing. PNG is a more
gd: compact format, and full compression is available. JPEG works well
gd: with photographic images, and is still more compatible with the major
gd: Web browsers than even PNG is. WBMP is intended for wireless devices
gd: (not regular web browsers).
