libsigc++: libsigc++ (Callback Framework for C++)
libsigc++:
libsigc++: libsigc++ implements a typesafe callback system for standard
libsigc++: C++. It allows you to define signals and to connect those signals
libsigc++: to any callback function, either global or a member function,
libsigc++: regardless of whether it is static or virtual.  It also contains
libsigc++: adaptor classes for connection of dissimilar callbacks and has an
libsigc++: ease of use unmatched by other C++ callback libraries. Libsigc++
