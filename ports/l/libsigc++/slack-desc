libsigc++: libsigc++ (Callback Framework for C++)
libsigc++:
libsigc++: libsigc++ implements a typesafe callback system for
libsigc++: standard C++. It allows you to define signals and to
libsigc++: connect those signals to any callback function, either
libsigc++: global or a member function, regardless of whether it is
libsigc++: static or virtual.
libsigc++: It also contains adaptor classes for connection of
libsigc++: dissimilar callbacks and has an ease of use unmatched by
libsigc++: other C++ callback libraries. Libsigc++ is licensed under
