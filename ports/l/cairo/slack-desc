cairo: A vector graphics library
cairo:
cairo: Cairo is a vector graphics library designed to provide high-quality
cairo: display and print output. Currently available backends include the
cairo: X Window System, OpenGL (via [WWW]glitz), Quartz, win32, in-memory
cairo: image buffers, PNG images, PostScript, and PDF files. Some of these
cairo: backends are still experimental. Cairo is designed to produce
cairo: identical output on all output media while taking advantage of
cairo: display hardware acceleration when available (eg. through the X
cairo: Render Extension or OpenGL).
