gift-openft: gift-openft (OpenFT-plugin for gift)
gift-openft:
gift-openft: OpenFT is a peer-to-peer network designed and implemented by/for the
gift-openft: giFT project. Originally, giFT began as a client purely for the
gift-openft: FastTrack network but the original development was halted after
gift-openft: numerous "security updates" made by FastTrack which changed
gift-openft: compatibility in such a way that made it difficult to regain access. As
gift-openft: a result, OpenFT was designed to provide an open network loosely based
gift-openft: on the concepts understood from the reverse engineering of the
gift-openft: FastTrack network.
