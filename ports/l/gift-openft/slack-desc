gift-openft: gift-openft (OpenFT-plugin for gift)
gift-openft:
gift-openft: OpenFT is a peer-to-peer network designed and implemented
gift-openft: by/for the giFT project. Originally, giFT began as a
gift-openft: client purely for the FastTrack network but the original
gift-openft: development was halted after numerous "security updates"
gift-openft: made by FastTrack which changed compatibility in such a
gift-openft: way that made it difficult to regain access. As a result,
gift-openft: OpenFT was designed to provide an open network loosely based
gift-openft: on the concepts understood from the reverse engineering of
gift-openft: the FastTrack network.
