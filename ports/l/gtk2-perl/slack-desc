gtk2-perl: Gtk2
gtk2-perl:
gtk2-perl: Perl bindings to the 2.x series of the Gtk+ graphical user
gtk2-perl: interface library.  This module allows you to write graphical
gtk2-perl: user interfaces in a perlish and object-oriented way, freeing
gtk2-perl: you from the casting and memory management in C, yet remaining
gtk2-perl: very close in spirit to original API.  Find out more about Gtk+
gtk2-perl: at http://www.gtk.org.
