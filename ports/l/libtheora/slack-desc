libtheora: libtheora (open video codec)
libtheora:
libtheora: Theora is an open video codec being developed by the Xiph.org
libtheora: Foundation as part of their Ogg project (It is a project that
libtheora: aims to integrate On2's VP3 video codec, Ogg Vorbis audio codec
libtheora: and Ogg multimedia container formats into a multimedia solution
libtheora: that can compete with MPEG-4 format).  Theora is derived directly
libtheora: from On2's VP3 codec; currently the two are nearly identical,
libtheora: varying only in framing headers, but Theora will diverge and
libtheora: improve from the main VP3 development lineage as time progresses.
