xml-writer:
xml-writer: XML::Writer is a simple Perl module for writing XML documents:
xml-writer: it takes care of constructing markup and escaping data
xml-writer: correctly, and by default, it also performs a significant
xml-writer: amount of well-formedness checking on the output, to make
xml-writer: certain (for example) that start and end tags match, that
xml-writer: there is exactly one document element, and that there are not
xml-writer: duplicate attribute names.
