libdvbpsi4: The libdvbpsi is part of the VideoLAN project, a full MPEG2

libdvbpsi4: The VideoLAN team decided to write the libdvbpsi to make
libdvbpsi4: the VideoLAN Client and the VideoLAN Server capable of
libdvbpsi4: demultiplexing a satellite DVB stream. The library aims
libdvbpsi4: at making it easy to decode PSI tables (such as PAT, PMT
libdvbpsi4: etc.) present in a TS/DVB stream.
