fftw: FFTW
fftw:
fftw: FFTW is a free collection of fast C routines for computing the
fftw: Discrete Fourier Transform in one or more dimensions.  It
fftw: includes complex, real, symmetric, and parallel transforms, and
fftw: can handle arbitrary array sizes efficiently.  FFTW is typically
fftw: faster than other publically-available FFT implementations, and
fftw: is even competitive with vendor-tuned libraries.  (See our web
fftw: page for extensive benchmarks.)  To achieve this performance,
fftw: FFTW uses novel code-generation and runtime self-optimization
fftw: techniques (along with many other tricks).
