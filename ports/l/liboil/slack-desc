liboil: liboil
liboil:
liboil: Liboil is a library of simple functions that are optimized for
liboil: various CPUs. These functions are generally loops implementing
liboil: simple algorithms, such as converting an array of N integers
liboil: to floating-point numbers or multiplying and summing an array
liboil: of N numbers. Such functions are candidates for significant
liboil: optimization using various techniques, especially by using
liboil: extended instructions provided by modern CPUs (Altivec, MMX,
liboil: SSE, etc.).
