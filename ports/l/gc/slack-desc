gc: gc (A garbage collector for C and C++)
gc:
gc: The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector can be used as
gc: a garbage collecting replacement for C malloc or C++ new. It allows
gc: you to allocate memory basically as you normally would, without
gc: explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The collector
gc: automatically recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer
gc: be otherwise accessed. A simple example of such a use is given here.
