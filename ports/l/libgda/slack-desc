libgda: GNU Data Access (GDA) is an attempt to provide uniform access
libgda: to different kinds of data sources (databases, information
libgda: servers, mail spools, etc). It is a complete architecture that
libgda: provides all you need to access your data. It is defined by a
libgda: set of plugin APIs as generic as possible (but very powerful
libgda: at the same time) so that any kind of data source can be
libgda: accessed through them.
