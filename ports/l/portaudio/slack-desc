portaudio: an Open Source Cross Platform Audio API
portaudio:
portaudio: PortAudio is a library that provides streaming audio input and
portaudio: output. It is a cross-platform API (Application Programming
portaudio: Interface) that works on Windows, Macintosh, Unix running OSS,
portaudio: SGI, BeOS, and perhaps other platforms by the time you read
portaudio: this. This means that you can write a simple 'C' program to
portaudio: process or generate an audio signal, and that program can run
portaudio: on several different types of computer just by recompiling the
portaudio: source code.
