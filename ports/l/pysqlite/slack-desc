pysqlite: pysqlite (DB-2.0-compliant database interface for SQLite)
pysqlite:
pysqlite: SQLite is a relational database management system contained
pysqlite: in a relatively small C library. It is a public domain
pysqlite: project created by D. Richard Hipp. Unlike the usual
pysqlite: client-server paradigm, the SQLite engine is not a
pysqlite: standalone process with which the program communicates, but
pysqlite: is linked in and thus becomes an integral part of the
pysqlite: program. The library implements most of SQL-92 standard,
pysqlite: including transactions, triggers and most of complex
pysqlite: queries.
