libnet: The Libnet Packet Construction Library
libnet:
libnet: Libnet is a high-level API (toolkit) allowing the application
libnet: programmer to construct and inject network packets. It provides
libnet: a portable and simplified interface for low-level network
libnet: packet shaping, handling and injection. Libnet hides much of the
libnet: tedium of packet creation from the application programmer such as
libnet: multiplexing, buffer management, arcane packet header information,
libnet: byte-ordering, OS-dependent issues, and much more.
