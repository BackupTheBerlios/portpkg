libast:
libast: The Library of Assorted Spiffy Things (LibAST -
libast: formerly libmej) was originally designed as a
libast: companion library to Eterm. However, it contains many
libast: features that other projects may find useful, so it
libast: has been broken out into its own library. Features
libast: include thorough debugging and memory tracking
libast: engines, various string manipulation functions,
libast: and a flexible config file parsing engine.
