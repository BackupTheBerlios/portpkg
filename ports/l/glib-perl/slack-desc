glib-perl: Perl wrappers for the GLib utility and Object libraries
glib-perl:
glib-perl: This module provides perl access to Glib and GLib's GObject
glib-perl: libraries.  GLib is a portability and utility library; GObject
glib-perl: provides a generic type system with inheritance and a powerful
glib-perl: signal system.  Together these libraries are used as the
glib-perl: foundation for many of the libraries that make up the Gnome
glib-perl: environment, and are used in many unrelated projects.
