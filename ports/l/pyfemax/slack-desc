pyfemax:
pyfemax: PyFemax is a set of Python modules containing the
pyfemax: application-specific code:
pyfemax: 
pyfemax: * a finite element code for discretising Maxwell's equations using
pyfemax: second order Nédélec finite elements * eigenvalue solvers for the
pyfemax: Maxwell problem, building on top of the JDSYM solver in PySparse *
pyfemax: various file import routines for reading tetrahedral mesh data *
pyfemax: postprocessing routines for visualising the electromagnetic fields
pyfemax: using VTK [4] or MayaVi
